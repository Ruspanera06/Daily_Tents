# 🌳 Tents & Trees Logic Solver – University Project

# [**Project Link**](https://github.com/Ruspanera06/Tents_Solver)

---

## 🎮 Description  
This project is a reconstruction of the puzzle game **Tents & Trees**, developed as an independent university exercise.

Unlike traditional versions, this implementation was intentionally built **without an automatic puzzle generator**.  
Instead, the focus was on reproducing:

- ✔️ Rule validation  
- ✔️ Game state modelling  
- ✔️ Logical deduction and decision making  
- ✔️ A basic reasoning automaton  

---

## 🔍 What It Does  
The game allows the player (or solver) to:

- Place tents or grass manually  
- Detect rule violations  
- Propagate forced consequences  
- Perform reasoning through a simple automated system

The automaton simulates logical deduction — marking guaranteed tiles and rejecting impossible configurations — rather than brute-forcing solutions.

---

## 🧩 Development Goals  
The purpose of this project was:

- To explore **constraint-based puzzle solving**
- To learn **state propagation, recursion and branching**
- To implement rule checking without an external solver engine

It represents an experiment in thinking like the puzzle itself — *without requiring map creation algorithms*.

## 💡 Technical Focus  

This project allowed me to practice:

- 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- 🔁 Recursive hypothesis testing  
- ✔️ Constraint validation  
- 🤖 Basic automated deduction  
- 🧮 Board state analysis and consistency detection  

Although not built to be optimal or industrial-grade, it reflects **reasoning logic over performance**.

---

## 🎯 Goal  
To recreate the logical system of **Tents & Trees** while experimenting with:

> Automated reasoning, puzzle logic, and error propagation.

The intent was educational — understanding *how* the rules work and how a solver might think.

## 📌 Notes  
This project was my **first logic-based solver experiment**, following my previous game recreation work.  
It helped bridge gameplay programming with algorithmic reasoning.
